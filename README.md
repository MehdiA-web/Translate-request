# Translation Request Process

This project manages translation requests and handles the flow between the source process and target process. The flow consists of multiple roles: Requesters, Managers, and Translators.

## Overview

The translation request process consists of two main parts:
1. **Source Process**: Users submit translation requests which are reviewed by the manager.
2. **Target Process**: Translators provide the requested translation after the request is approved.

### Source Process Workflow

1. **Requester Submits Request**: A user submits a translation request.
2. **Manager Review**: 
   - If approved, the request is sent to translators.
   - If rejected, the process ends here.
3. **Assign to Translators**: Translators are assigned to the translation request.
4. **Upload Translation**: Translators complete the translation and upload the file.
5. **Payment and File Delivery**: The requester makes payment, and the translated file is delivered.

### Cost and Time Approval Workflow

1. **Translators Submit Estimate**: Translators provide an estimate of the cost and time for the translation.
2. **Manager Review**:
   - If the cost or time needs revision, it is sent back to the translator.
   - If approved, the cost and time are confirmed.
